# BMI-Calculator

This is a project for a BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator developed in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. BMI is a measure used to assess if a person is at their ideal weight according to their height and weight. With this calculator, users can input their weight and height values and obtain their BMI value, as well as an assessment of their weight status. You can access the project at the following link: "https://bmi-calculator-ten-weld.vercel.app/".

This project is a simple application that uses HTML for the page structure, CSS for the visual style, and JavaScript for the BMI calculation and page update. This project is intended for educational purposes and can serve as a foundation for other projects that involve similar calculations.

The objective of this repository is to provide a reference for beginner developers in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as a foundation for improving and expanding the functionalities of the BMI Calculator. Feel free to collaborate, suggest improvements, or adapt the project to your needs.
